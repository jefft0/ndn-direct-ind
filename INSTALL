NDN-DIRECT-IND: A javascript client library for Named Data Networking
---------------------------------------------------------------------

BASIC LIBRARY: NO BUILD REQUIRED
================================
The basic NDN-DIRECT-IND library does not need to be "built".  To use the library in the
browser, include build/ndn.js. See the examples in examples/browser.

To use the library in Node.js, require index.js at the top of the distribution tree.
See the examples programs in examples/node.

BUILD A COMBINED, COMPRESSED LIBRARY 
====================================

While the combined file ndn.js is useful for debugging, a more efficient way to include the library 
is to used the combined, compressed library build/ndn.min.js.
While we try to keep a built version in that directory for convenience, it
may fall out of sync with the library, so we recommend building it as follows if possible.
To build ndn.min.js, Java must be installed.

To create a combined and compressed versions of NDN-DIRECT-IND scripts:

    ./waf configure
    ./waf

These commands will create a combined version build/ndn.js, and combined version build/ndn.min.js, compressed 
using  Google's Closure Compiler.

The compressed version is what we recommend including in applications.

DOCUMENTATION
=============
The documentation is auto-generated using JSDoc.  If you don't have JSDoc installed, in a terminal enter:

    sudo npm install -g jsdoc

To make documentation, cd to the root directory of ndn-js and run the following command to put the output in subdirectory doc:

    npm run doc

WEBSOCKETS PROXY
================

If you wish to run your own WebSockets proxy instead of using the NDN testbed, you must
build and install Node.js (often on the machine also running the ndnd you wish to proxy
for, but that doesn't have to be the case).  See wsproxy/README.md
